  <i>A library for PaperMC plugin developers.</i>

# What is it?

Dusk is a library designed specifically for PaperMC, ensuring guaranteed integration with the platform. With Dusk, you can take your plugin to the next level with some useful features, such as the menu builder, extensive Kotlin support, and more. Dusk provides a solid foundation for your plugins, allowing you to take full advantage of your plugin's possible features.

# Where can I learn it?

You can learn it by using our [wiki](https://dusk.akkih.com/)! Everything is documented over there and I'm sure you will not have problems figuring it out.

# Background
I just felt like no library could fit my necessities. I'm a very strict person when it comes to organizing code and coding itself, and having to implement many libraries that probably would not even work as I intended, made it even worse.

That's when I came up with the idea of creating a library for myself. Most features that are present in Dusk, are features that I most likely copied from some other library and bundled it together here so it was easier for me to manage and customize them as I needed.

I'm willing to add way more features to it: database management, NPCs support, a simple command framework, and much more. Mainly because those are features I definitely will need to work with at some point, and because I want other people to be able to use them as well.

I tried to make Dusk as customizable as possible for everyone, and I'm always accepting new ideas and am willing to add more features as people ask for them.

# Credits

I want to thank [flytegg/twilight](https://github.com/flytegg/twilight) for many features I use in Dusk. This would not be possible without you. :heart:
