# What is it?

Dusk is a library designed specifically for PaperMC, ensuring guaranteed integration with the 
platform. With Dusk, you can take your plugin to the next level with some useful features, such 
as the menu builder, extensive Kotlin support, and more. Dusk provides a solid foundation for your 
plugins, allowing you to take full advantage of your plugin's possible features.

# Where can I learn it?

You can learn it by using our [wiki](https://dusk.akkih.com/)! Everything is documented over there and
I'm sure you will not have problems figuring it out.
